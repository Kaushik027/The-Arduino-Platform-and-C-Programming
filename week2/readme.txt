/*
    Fibonacci
    Prints out the first n (where n set as a constant)
    digits in the Fibonacci sequence.

    This program is for the Week 2 assignment in the
    Coursera The Arduino Platform and C Programming course.

    Instructions:
        Write a program in C that computes and prints out the first
        six digits in the Fibonacci sequence. You will need to look
        up the definition of the Fibonacci sequence if you don't
        know it. The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1,
        but your program should compute the next four digits. Turn
        in your C program. Your C program must compile in order for
        it to be tested.

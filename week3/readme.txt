   fastslowblink
   Blinks LED 13 on the Arduino UNO 5 times, once every half second,
   and then blinks 5 more times once every 2 seconds.

   This program is for the Week 3 assignment in the
   Coursera The Arduino Platform and C Programming course.

   Instructions:
      Write a program that causes the built-in LED connected to pin 13
      on the Arduino to blink, alternating between fast blinks and slow
      blinks. The LED should blink 5 times, once every half second,
      and then it should blink 5 more times, once every two seconds.
      The LED should continue to blink in this alternating fashion for
      as long as the Arduino receives power.
